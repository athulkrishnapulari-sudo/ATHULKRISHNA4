The Contact_book.py is a Python project designed to store contact details. 
Users can add, delete, search, and view all contacts. 
The program validates user inputs. It ensures that contact numbers contain exactly 10 digits and only digits, and that email addresses contain both '@' and '.' .
Users can view their contacts in a clean and organized format. 
The program is simple to use â€” just select a choice from the main menu and follow the prompts.

MY LEARNING JOURNEY

I have studied Python before and understood the logic of the code, but I had forgotten how some of the built-in Python functions work. Throughout this project, I read the Python documentation carefully and revisited the functionality of these functions, which helped me strengthen my understanding and apply them effectively.
